# PurpleAir
PurpleAir makes inexpensive air pollution sensors. The air sensors track PM2.5 concentrations. PM2.5 is short Particulate Matter 2.5 Micron, which is small particles such as from burning matter.  PurpleAir data is available over the Internet, i.e. the sensors are part of the Internet of Things (IoT). The data can be accessed through Thingspeak, although it does require initially getting specific sensor info from Purpleair site itself.

Initial item here is a Tableau Web Data Connector for the Purpleair data from Purpleair directly.
